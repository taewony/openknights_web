## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#72BCD4) to give a sense of calm, competence, and reliability appropriate for a tool to manage data and coordinate efforts.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), providing a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Muted green (#8FBC8F) for interactive elements and key actions, providing a sense of assurance without causing distraction.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), for body text because it provides excellent readability at various sizes. Headings: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), for a modern, somewhat techy, look to section headings and other emphasized text.
- Simple, flat icons to represent contests, projects, and users, maintaining a consistent visual language.
- A clear, responsive layout with a sidebar or top navbar for navigation, optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
